# Welcome to Mybrary!

This is a simple library application that allows users to add, edit, and delete books and authors. This application helped me learn more about using Node.js for backend (I was using Flask previously). You can find the tutorials for this project [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM). All credits goes to [Web Dev Simplied](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) for the wonderful tutorials.

I host my latest version of the web application on Heroku. You can find it [here](https://btnguyen-mybrary.herokuapp.com/)
